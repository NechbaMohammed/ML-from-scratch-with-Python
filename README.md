# ML-from-scratch-with-Python
In this package, we've implemented a few basic machine learning algorithms from scratch. The algorithms are implemented in Python 3.8. The algorithms are as follows:

  - [Single Layer Perceptron Algorithm](https://github.com/NechbaMohammed/ML-from-scratch-with-Python/tree/main/Lab1/Perceptron)
Pocket Perceptron
Adaline Algorithm with delta rule
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Polynomial Regression
One-vs-All and One-vs-One Classifiers
Furthermore, we've implemented a few basic algorithms useful in the cristalization of learning theory :

Non-Linear Transformation
Cross Validation with K-Fold
Gradient Descent for Linear and Logistic Regression
Regularization for Linear and Logistic Regression
Bias and Variance (not implemented yet)
Vapnik Chervonenkis Dimension (VC-Dimension)
Covering and Uniform Covering Number
Finally, we also added a few basic functions to help you create dummy data and plot results of the algorithms :

Generate Dummy Data (in 2D and 3D)
Plot Linear Decision Boundary (in 2D and 2D)
Plot Non-Linear Decision Boundary (in 2D)
Plot Linear Regression (in 2D)
